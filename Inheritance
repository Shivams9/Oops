# Class Lion         # Class cub

# Inheritance is like creating a specialized version of a class. Ex : we could create a "Cub" class that inherit form the "LION" class.
# It has all the attributes and methods of "LION",but we could add new ones,like play().


#Define a new class that inherit from the lion class
class cub(lion):
    def __init__(self,color,weight,age):
        super().__init__(color,weight,age)
        
    def play(self):
        return "The cub s playing"
        
#Create an object of the class
nala = cub("golden",50,1)

#nala can use the method of the lion class
print(nala.roar())

#And also the new method from the cub class
print(nala..play())
