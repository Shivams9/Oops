# Abstraction is like providing simple interface for zoo visitiors to intract with the zoo.
# They don't need to know how the zoo works, they just need to know what actions they can observe (watch a lion eat,hear a lion ROAR etc)

# We don't need to know the make_sound,eat,sleep methods work
# We just need to know that we can call them

print(simba.make_sound())
print(simba.eat())
print(simba.sleep())
