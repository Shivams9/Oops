#  Class = Class is like a blueprint. Ex : Lion in Zoo. All lions have common characteristics like Color,Weight, and Age and 
common actions like Roar, Eat, Sleep. So Lion is a class with attributes (color,weight, age) and methods (Roar,Eat, Sleep).

#  Object = An object is a specific instance of a class. Ex : "Simba" is an object of "Lion" class.
#Define class
class lion:
    def __init__(self,color,weight,age,):
        self.color=color
        self.weight=weight
        self.age=age
        
    def roar(self):
        return "ROAR!"
        
    def eat(self):
        return "The lion is eating."
        
    def sleep(self):
        return "The lion is sleeping."
        
    
#Create an object of the lion class
simba=lion("golded",99,3)

#Using attributes
print(simba.color)
print(simba.weight)
print(simba.age)

#Using Methods
print(simba.roar())
print(simba.eat())
print(simba.sleep())
